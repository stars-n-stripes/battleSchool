# Battle School

## Purpose
The purpose of Battle School is based on three tenets:
1. **Modularity**: the Battle School should be able to virtualize a large range of labs, challenges, and wargames that teach and test skills in cybersecurity. These scenarios should share a common configuration format
2. **Portability**: the Battle School should be able to be deployed either on a bare metal server or a cloud environment that supports nested virtualization withouth any functional difference
3. **Mentorship**: the Battle School will eventually collect data on student and network actions that occur during a scenario, allowing mentors and teachers to best isolate where instruction should occur
